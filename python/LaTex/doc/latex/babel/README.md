## Babel 3.29

This package manages culturally-determined typographical (and other)
rules, and hyphenation patterns for a wide range of languages.  Many
language styles work with pdflatex, as well as with xelatex and
lualatex out of the box.  A few even work with plain formats.

The latest stable version is available on <https://ctan.org/pkg/babel>.

Languages are not part of the Babel core any more; in particular, it
shall be no longer necessary to synchronize Babel core releases with
releases of Babel language files. See CONTRIB for further details
about contributing a language. You may also create an ini file or
improve the existing ones -- it's a trivial task (no programming
skills required at all), but don't hesitate to ask for help.

Included is a set of ini files for about 200 languages.

The best way to install and/or update it is with the help of package
managers.

Changes are described in babel.pdf with the label "New <version>". The
manual has been expanded to include some tips and tricks, but it will
be improved in next releases.

### Reporting Bugs

If you wish to report a problem or bug in any of these packages please
use the
[Issue Tracker for LaTeX2e on GitHub](https://github.com/latex3/babel/issues)
and follow the guidelines that pop up if you press the `New issue`
button.

In particular, to check that you are really seeing a bug, please write
a short, self-contained document that shows the problem. This should
include the `latexbug` package, which will warn if your test file is
not suitable for one or the other reason. See the
[CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for further details, or if you need to obtain the `latexbug` package.

If the bug turns out to be with third-party software then please
contact the developer, and not us!

You may also report them to the author more informally on:

Bugs related to specific languages are best reported to their
respective authors.

### Latest changes

```
3.29   - The fix for boxes inside math is incompatible with ams.
         Removed (a better fix is under study).
       - Options bidi-l and bidi-r (for the bidi package).
3.28   - Fixes - wrong dir after math, in math inside tabular, in weak L
         inside R inside L, and in boxes inside math.
       - \babelfont now takes into account \defaultfontfeatures. This
         is a potential source of backwards incompatibilities, but
         very likely the risks are very low, and it is, I think, the
         expected behavior.
3.27   - Preliminary support for bidi (by Vafa Khalighi) with xetex.
       - Fix for 3.23 - \ensureascii was redefined even when not 
         necessary.
       - Minor improvements in babel-vi.ini.
3.26   - Fix for 3.25 - \babelprovide raised an error with xetex. 
3.25   - Fixes for 3.23 - mapfont=direction could raise an error.
         Language and Script were not always defined correctly.
       - Improved tentative support for Thai, Lao and Khmer in both 
         luatex and xetex.
3.24   - Prelimimary support for Thai interword spacing with luatex.
3.23   - After extensive tests and fixing some issues, bidi=basic is 
         not experimental any longer.
       - import in \babelprovide does not require a language code if
         the language name is a recognized one.
       - New macro: \ifbabelshorthand.
       - TS1, T3 and TS3 have been added to the non-ascii list, to 
         avoid problems in case no ASCII-savvy encoding is requested.
       - Define Language and Script if fontspec does not known them (eg, 
         the Japanese script).
       - Set the \thepage bidi bahavior in foots/heads.
       - Fix - Undefined \bbl@stripslash in Plain.
3.22   - Fix - Error with \chapter if empty in ini
       - Prelimimary support for Sanskrit
       - Unknown languages in aux files do not raise an error
         any more (only show a warning).
3.21   - Fix - equation numbers raised an error.
       - Two minor changes: if no language is requested load nil 
         instead of raising an error, and the message 'babel <x.x>...'
         is not printed to the log any more.
3.20   - ini files with the field digits.native define
         \<language>digits and \<language>counters. \arabic can be
         redefined to use native digits.
       - Fix - mapfont in bidi=basic didn't take into account combining
         marks (eg, Arabic vowels).
       - Fix - A bug introduced in 3.19, which sometimes reversed text 
         in \hbox'es.
       - Fix for luatex 1.07 - An internal change in luatex broke
         bidi at 'automatic' hyphens.
       - Fix for latest latex - babel.ins raised an error.
3.19   - Most changes are for luatex:
         . The main new feature is a bidi method for both implicit L in
           R text, and implicit R in L text, with the possibility of
           switching the font automatically. Still somewhat
           experimental, but it should work in most cases.
         . layout=extras for a couple of miscellaneous readjustments.
         . bidi equation numbers.
       - Also, for all engines, new field in some ini files:
         digits.native (to be used in future releases).
         
3.18   - More bidi in luatex: captions (required only in multilingual
         docs) and tabular (required for R tables). Also an experimental
         support for captions in xetex and pdftex (tabular is not yet
         supported).
       - New ini files: ar-DZ, ar-MA, ar-SY
       - Fix - \begin{hyphenrules} didn't work with polyglossia.
       - Fix - switch.def was loaded twice.
       
3.17   - A tool for bidi footnotes.
       - Fix - \ragged... didn't work for bidi.
       
3.16   - New package option layout for bidi documents.
       - Quotes in TU encoding
       - Fix - \<language>date did not work correctly
       - Fix - with some languages (eg, british), using
         \babelfont raised an error.
